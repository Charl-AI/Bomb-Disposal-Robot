# Bomb-Disposal-Robot
Embedded C for Microcontrollers final project. This project was completed in two weeks and achieved a mark of 80 % (A+).

This robot autonomously searches for a suspicious infrared-emitting beacon. It then scans the beacon for an RFID tag and returns to the starting position. This was implemented on a PIC18F4331 8-bit microcontroller with basic electronic components assembled on a breadboard and robot base.
